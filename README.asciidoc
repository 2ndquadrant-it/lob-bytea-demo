= LOB and Bytea in PostgreSQL

This is an application that shows how to work with Bytea and LOBs in C and Java.
Other languages version may arrive soon.

== The C program

C version of the program can be found in +C+ directory, compile it with +make+:

----
$ cd C
$ make
----

then launch the program with:

----
$ ./lotest DSN COMMAND # Read below for detailed instructions
----


== The Java program

To install the Java version of the program you need +Maven+.+
Assuming that it is installed and it is present in the binary path, change to the java directory:

----
$ cd java
----

And run +Maven+:

----
$ mvn assembly:assembly
----

Wait until building process finish.
You can find resulting jar files in the +target+ directory, in particular:

----
$ ls target/*.jar
target/lotest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar target/lotest-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----

Launch the "with-dependencies" one with:

----
$ cd target
$ java -jar lotest-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----

== Usage

Both versions of this program (C and Java) have the same usage interface:

----
Usage:
 ./lotest DSN lob {import|export|remove}
 ./lotest DSN bytea {import|export|remove}
 ./lotest DSN list

Command help:
 DSN lob import <filename>
   This command imports <filename> as LOB, and returns its oid

 DSN lob export <oid> <filename>
   This command exports LOB <oid> as <filename>.
   You can view OIDs actually in the catalog with list command

 DSN lob remove <oid>
   This command removes LOB <oid> from Postgres.
   You can view OIDs actually in the catalog with list command

 DSN bytea import <oid>
   This command imports <filename> as a BYTEA.

 DSN bytea export <oid>
   This command exports bytea <oid> as <filename>.
   You can view OIDs actually in the catalog with list command

 DSN bytea remove <oid>
   This command removes BYTEA <oid>.
   You can view OIDs actually in the catalog with list command

 DSN list
   This command shows the actual catalogue.
----

That's easy. +
The +DSN+ argument may require some explanation. +

+DSN+ stand for *Database Source Name* and it is the string that +lotest+ will use to connect to your Postgres instance. +
The +DSN+ string contains information about _host_, _port_, _user_ and _database name_. +

For example, this is a valid DSN to be used with C version of this program:

----
"host=localhost dbname=postgres user=postgres port=5432"
----

This one is for the Java version:

----
127.0.0.1:5432/dbname,username,password
----

Change parameters to suit your needs.
